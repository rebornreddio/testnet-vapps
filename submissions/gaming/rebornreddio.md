## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: your vaps wkwkw
- **Category**: identity/defi/social/gaming/infrastructure/other

### Description
What problem does your vApp solve? What does it do?

In current Web2 and Web3 games, players must trust that the random number generation (RNG) mechanism for loot boxes is truly random and fair. There are concerns about manipulation or rigging. What it Does: Zero-Roll is a smart contract protocol that verifies the distribution of rare items in loot boxes using Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Players can prove they received items according to the promised probability, without having to reveal seeds or other secret inputs, ensuring total fairness.

### SL Integration  
How will you use Soundness Layer? What specific SL features?

1. ZK Proof Verification: The Soundness Layer will be used as a trustless verification layer for each loot box opening result.

2. Specific SL Features: We will utilize the Soundness Layer to verify the ligetron proofs generated by our game backend. Each time a player opens a loot box, the backend will generate a ZK proof proving that the item result was generated by a legitimate RNG. This proof will then be sent to the SL for fast, low-latency on-chain verification before the item is delivered to the player.

## Technical

High-Level System Design:

1. Frontend: Players interact through the UI (e.g., the "Open Loot Box" button).

2. Game Backend (Prover): The backend runs the RNG algorithm and generates a ZK proof (using an SL-compatible prover, such as Ligetron).

3. Soundness CLI: The backend automatically calls the Soundness CLI (soundness-cli send...) to send the proof-blob-id and payload to the Soundness Layer.

4. Soundness Layer (Verifier): The SL verifies the proof.

5. Smart Contract: Upon successful verification by the SL, a smart contract on the main chain (e.g., Sui) triggers the minting of the NFT item the player obtained.
